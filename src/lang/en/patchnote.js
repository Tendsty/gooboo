I am making a few changes to the reward systems of this feature to make school more optional, especially in the early game where time skipping is much more valuable.',
    11: 'Golden dust gain reduced if your global level is below 250 (linear)',

    13: 'Using the X button in literature no longer causes an error',

    // v1.1.0
    14: 'Last patch I already introduced some band-aid solutions to address the school system. While they did help a little in making the game less about grinding school all the time, they did not fix the underlying issues. This rework is aimed at reducing the amount of time pressure some players felt, and removing the grind aspects while still keeping school as an occasional option to get golden dust. After all, Gooboo is supposed to be a long-term idle game, not an active incremental. This was also a great opportunity to clean up the intransparent system of elo and grades.',

    88: 'Turning off note notifications now clears existing hints',
    89: 'Over the last few days, it became clear that quick 15-minute-prestiges were by far the best strategy to get souls in the horde. Runs that took a day could barely get twice the amount of souls, and existing elements to combat this are clearly not working. This is against the idle-focused philosophy of Gooboo, and while active gameplay should always be the most efficient option, it should not render other options of progress meaningless. These changes aim to reduce the gap between players with very fast prestiges and others who prestige one or two times a day.',
